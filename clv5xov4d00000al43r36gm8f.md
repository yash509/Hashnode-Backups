# Understanding the Version Control Systems:

A version control system is essentially a piece of software for managing and tracking changes to documents, source code, and other items. Version Control Systems (VCS) enable developers to work with colleagues simultaneously, roll back to earlier versions, and keep a clear audit trail of modifications by recording each alteration.

Version control is the practice of monitoring and controlling modifications made to digital assets over time. Version control may be applied in a variety of ways, for as by following a set of organizational and file naming guidelines. On the other hand, version control discussions usually center around version control systems or software. The purpose of these technologies is to support teams in working concurrently and avoid losing track of crucial tasks. Although "source control" refers specifically to tracking source code, "version control" is sometimes used synonymously with it.  
  
All development teams, regardless of industry, need version control software. They can work on the same project concurrently and handle code and file changes over time thanks to it. Better communication and quicker development are made possible by an effective version control system, which also provides you with a comprehensive history of your digital assets.

Version control can be automated with the use of a version control system (VCS) or version control software. Rather than requiring you to manually monitor file versions or use specialized automation scripts, it records changes made to a file or collection of files over time. Your code and other files are fully tracked by a version control system, which makes it possible for you to go back to a prior version when necessary.

## Branching and Merging Strategy in Version Control Systems or Software

![version control - Branching and Merging Strategies - Stack Overflow](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9cJWV.gif align="center")

One essential feature of version control systems is branching. Historical asset modifications are displayed in a diverging hierarchy in the graphic below. Assets in a trunk line are represented by the centerline. All of the divergences are regarded as branches of the trunk line, sometimes known as the "mainline". These differences are referred to as "branches" in most version control systems. Branches aid in shielding the mainline from unforeseen issues brought about by branch modifications. For the project's integrity as a whole, this separation is crucial. The divergence, or differences, between the mainline and each branch increases over time as change increases in both the mainline and each branch. Changes made to a branch must be merged back into their original origin branch (often the mainline) in order to reflect the significant work that has been done there. This is commonly called a "merge."  
  
Conflicts between the combined branches are possible after merges. For the project to move forward error-free, these conflicts have to be (or ought to be) addressed. In addition to keeping issues from escalating, this maintains the mainline's excellent functioning assets. Maintaining a "good" mainline is a fundamental tenet of an effective version control system. In order to expand on earlier work or address incorrect behavior that was unintentionally introduced, branches from the mainline must be able to be established (sometimes known as "bug fixes").

## Why Version Control System is important?

Maintaining track of modifications to files, code, and other digital assets requires version control. When working on development projects with several team members, version control software should be used for all assets.

  
However, version control software must be capable of more than just file management and tracking. It ought to speed up the process of product development and delivery. The ability to test or build the most recent versions while submitting changes makes this particularly crucial for DevOps procedures. Potential conflicts should be flagged by effective version control systems before they are included into the project's mainline. Therefore, the issue may be resolved by the developer and won't spread to other areas.  

**Selecting the appropriate version control software:**

* Enhances the visibility.
    
* Reduces effort wastage and file conflicts.
    
* Facilitates the global team collaboration.
    
* Speeds up the delivery of products.
    

## Types of Version Control Systems

**Different Kinds of Version Control Systems are as follows:**

1. Centralized version control systems (CVCS): To make changes, developers check out files from this central repository, which is kept on a central server that houses the complete codebase's history. Concurrent Versions System (CVS) and Subversion (SVN) are two examples. CVCS can have single points of failure and restricted offline access, yet providing an organized method of version control.
    
2. Local Version Control Systems: Local Version Control Systems were used by programmers in the past. In a local database on their hard drives, these systems kept several file versions. This method offered minimal version control, but it was devoid of capabilities for collaboration and had a number of serious dangers, including the possibility of data loss in the event of hardware failure.
    
3. Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): These systems don't depend on a single central server. Rather, every developer keeps an exact duplicate of the repository, replete with all of its history. Well-known DVCSs include Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar. In addition to enabling offline work and lowering the possibility of data loss, this decentralized paradigm improves flexibility.
    

## How the Version Control System works?

The version control process is automated using version control software. Over time, it automatically logs modifications made to a file or group of files.  
  
The majority of version control software operates as follows, to put it simply:

* It creates a repository where files will be kept over time, along with all of their versions.
    
* Files kept in the repository are automatically recorded when modifications are made, allowing you to know exactly what was modified, when, and by whom.
    
* If one team member wants to work on a file, they may check it out, make changes, and when they're finished, commit or check the changes into the repository. By ensuring that others in the team are aware that the file is being worked on, this method of file checking helps to prevent them from overwriting each other's modifications. The team as a whole gets access to the most recent file version when modifications are checked back in. A team member using good version control software can "lock" a file to stop modifications from being made underneath their work. When working with huge binary assets that are difficult to integrate, this is quite crucial.
    
* A team member can make modifications to a project by creating a new branch, which allows them to experiment with new features without affecting other users. The project is mostly duplicated here. After making their adjustments independently in a separate branch, they can reintegrate it into the main branch.
    

## Benefits of Version Control Systems:

1. Disaster Recovery: Version control systems serve as a safety net, reducing the chance of catastrophic data loss. They also aid in disaster recovery. It is quite easy for developers to roll back to earlier versions in case of unintentional deletions or mistaken modifications, which reduces downtime.
    
2. Branching and Merging: Branching allows developers to set up separate environments in which they may test new features or apply bug fixes without compromising the main source code. Reverting changes to the master branch without difficulty preserves code integrity after they have been fully tested and verified.
    
3. Permits Parallel Development: You'll find yourself needing to maintain more and more versions of files, code, and whole products as your development projects get more complicated. The same project will probably have many team members working on it at once.
    
4. Version Tracking and History: Developers may follow the project's development over time by using Version Control Systems (VCS), which scrupulously records every change made to the source. Throughout debugging, troubleshooting, and auditing, this thorough version history is an invaluable resource.
    
5. Teamwork and Collaboration: Regardless of location or time zone, VCS enables developers to collaborate seamlessly with one another. The ability to collaborate on a project with several team members at once allows for effective merging of modifications.
    
6. Enables Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): VCS is essential to contemporary software development processes, especially pipelines for CI/CD. Version control is smoothy linked with automated testing, code review, and deployment procedures, guaranteeing dependable and quick software update delivery.
    

## Best Practices for Version Control:

1. Using Branching Strategies: Using a structured branching strategy, like GitHub Flow or Gitflow, improves code organization and optimizes development workflows. To preserve codebase cleanliness, establish explicit criteria for the creation of release branches, feature branches, and hotfixes.
    
2. Update and pull changes frequently: To keep up to speed with the most recent advancements, encourage team members to pull updates from the central repository on a regular basis. By following this procedure, disputes are reduced and it is guaranteed that everyone is using the most recent version of the code.
    
3. Simple and Descriptive Commit Messages: Every commit should have a brief but informative message outlining the modifications that were made. Well-written commit messages improve readability, encourage teamwork, and make it easier to locate certain changes.
    
4. Code Reviews and Peer Feedback: To promote teamwork, spot any problems early, and uphold code quality standards, integrate code review procedures into your workflow. Peer review increases the dependability of the code and encourages team knowledge exchange.
    
5. Backup and disaster recovery: To prevent data loss and guarantee company continuity, put strong backup procedures in place. Maintain regular backups of repository files to safe havens in the cloud and on-premises to reduce the chance of data loss from unanticipated events or hardware malfunctions.
